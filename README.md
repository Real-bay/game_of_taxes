# Short explanation of tests in prg2 (phase 2)

- test-skeleton-in/out.txt: Test functionality required for submission in Plussa
- smalltest-*-in/out.txt: A really simple minimal tests for operations (divided into separate test files, because most operations are non-compulsory)
- example-*-in/out.txt: The assignment specification's example, divided into separate files for each operation
- biggertest-*-in/out.txt: Bigger tests testing operations with town data from towns-data.txt (divided into separate test files, because most operations are non-compulsory)
- example-in/out.txt: The assignment specification's example run
- perftest-*.txt: These tests test the performance of various operations with growing number of towns and roads, using the main program perftest command

# Short explanation of tests in prg1 (phase 1)

- test-skeleton-in/out.txt: Test functionality required for skeleton (raakile) submissions (if you do only phase 1). This test **has to pass** correctly before Plussa accepts your submission (regardless of whether you just submit a skeleton or complete phase 1)
- simpletest-in/out.txt: A really simple minimal test containing all compulsory operations
- example-compulsory-in/out.txt: The assignment specification's example, but with only compulsory operations
- basictest-in/out.txt: A little bigger test testing compulsory operations with the town data in the assignment specification example
- biggertest-in/out.txt: A bigger test testing compulsory operations with town data from towns-data.txt an towns-vassals-data.txt
- noncompulsory-in/out.txt: A bigger test testing non-compulsory operations with town data from towns-data.txt an towns-vassals-data.txt
- example-in/out.txt: The assignment specification's example run
- perftest-*.txt: These tests test the performance of various operations with growing number of towns, using the main program perftest command
