Game Of Taxes
This program was a part of my Datastructures and Algorithms course during the fall of 2021. 

Note: Only the datastructures.cc, datastructures.hh and readme's are my own implementation, the rest of the program is a template provided as part of the course by the professor.

Prg1 and prg2 are each for different parts of the project, and prg2 expands on top of prg1. The main assignment was to implement functions to access and modify a database. The learning idea was to practice the implementation of efficient algorithms and features.
